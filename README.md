## Introduction
For my final year project, I built a first-peson shooter game in Unity 3D. I chose this route because I always had an interest in games,
especially first-person shooter games. Games like (Call of Duty), (Apex Legends), (BattleField) etc. inspired to build my own first-person
shooter game.

## Game Mechanism
The objective of the game is to survive. There are many enemy AI's around the map including zombies and spiders.
 

## Game Control Instructions

1. Move player forward = w/up key
2. Move player back = s/down key
3. Move player left = a/left key
4. Move player right = d/right key
5. To jump = space bar
6. To pick up a weapon = e
7. To shoot = left mouse button 
8. To reload = r
9. To open door = e
10. To pause the game = esc
